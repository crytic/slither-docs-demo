# Slither-docs action demo

This small repository shows how to setup [slither-doc action](https://github.com/crytic/slither-docs-action) in a small hardhat Solidity project taken from [our Echidna streaming sessions](https://github.com/crytic/echidna-streaming-series/tree/main/part2/staker). Each PR with the label "generate-docs" will force the action to run, in order to generate documentation. You can see an example PR with generated documentation [here](https://github.com/crytic/slither-docs-demo/pull/2).
